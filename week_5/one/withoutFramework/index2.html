<!--
    This file will do the same as index.html in this folder,
    But this has longer code, actually this is the code under 
    the hood react converts.
    As the application grows it becomes harder to write all the
    things in plain html/css/js (as in index.html) , but react 
    do lots of things for us, although in this file we
    are not using react functionalities.
